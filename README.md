# Overview
This open-source data pipeline shows sales results from two major e-commerce platforms in Brazil (Mercado Livre and Shopee) through an ELT pipeline that stores data in an on-premises star-schema data warehouse. 
The pipeline runs can be configured as the users see fi by changing the Apache Airflow DAGs.

## Requirements
To run this pipeline, the user needs:
1. A Mercado Livre seller account
2. A Mercado Livre application [(more on that here - PT/BR)](https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/en/crie-uma-aplicacao-no-mercado-livre)
3. A Shopee seller account
