# About the virtual environment

In case local testing is needed, this virtual Python environment has the requirements to run most of the pipeline's modules. The main exception is Apache Airflow, since it is Dockerized.

This environment was created in Windowws using Git Bash. To use it, you may type the following command on the project's root:

```
source venv/Scripts/Activate
```
